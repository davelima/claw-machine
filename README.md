# Handmade claw machine

This repository constains the source code of my claw machine project. It is a simple Arduino program that controls a few motors, a few buttons and a MP3 player for BGM/SFX.

Here is some pictures of the completed project. It has many 3D printed parts, a custom aluminum structure made with 2020 profiles and its encasing it's made with acrylic and MDF plates.
