# Deprecated

This was the initial version of this project, using hardwired TMC2130 drivers directly to Arduino.

Although it works, it proved to be extremely complex for this project, so this version was replaced by
the version on the root of this repository, which uses the CNC V3 shield with 3 A4988 drivers.

I'll keep this here for learning purposes.
